# CHAPTER 8
# 1. Assign any whole number to variable var_1 (1 pt.).
var_1 = 8


# 2. Write an if statement that assigns 10 to the variable var_2 and -5 to the variable var_3
# and prints the sum of var_2 and var_3, if the variable var_1 is less than or equal to 10 (3 pts.).

if var_1 <= 10:

	var_2 = 10
	var_3 = -5

	print(var_2 + var_3)


# 3. Assign any whole number to var_4 (1 pt.).
var_4 = 24



# 4. Write an if-else statement that prints out 'Yes you can', if var_4 is greater than 20 and
# prints out 'No you can not' if it is not greater than 20 (3 pts.).
# 5. Assign any positive whole number to pulse (1 pt.).
pulse =




# 6. Write an if-else statement that prints 'Your pulse is normal' if pulse
# is within the range of 60 to 100, inclusively. If pulse is outside the range,
# print 'Your pulse is not normal' (4 pts.).



# 7. Use the try except keywords to verify that a user has entered a valid int value by
# prompting the user to enter an integer. If the value is a valid integer, print out 'You entered a valid integer'.
# If the value is not a valid integer print out 'That is not a valid integer' (3 pts.).



# 8. Import the random module and generate two random integer numbers. The first random number
# should be between -25 and -60 and the second random number should be between 25 and 75.
# Print both random numbers (4 pts.).
