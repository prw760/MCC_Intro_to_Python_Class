# 1. Create a variable named num_1 and assign 14 to it (1 pt.).


# 2. Create a variable named num_2 and assign 79 to it (1 pt.).


# 3. Add num_1 to num_2 and store it in ans_one, print ans_one (2 pts.).


# 4. Subtract num_1 from num_2 and store it in ans_two, print ans_two (2 pts.).


# 5. Multiply num_1 by num_2 and store it in ans_three, print ans_three (2 pts.).


# 6. Divide num_2 by num_1 and store it in ans_four, print ans_four (2 pts.).


# 7. Use the integer division operator to divide num_2 by num_1 and store it in ans_five, print ans_five (2 pts.).


# 8. Return the remainder of num_2 divided by num_1 and store it in ans_six, print ans_six (2 pts.).


# 9. Use the is_integer method to check if num is an integer and print the value returned by the method (2 pts.).
num = 15.6 # DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY THIS LINE OF CODE


# 10. Use the pow function to print out 5 raised to the power of -3 (1 pt.).


# 11. Print num_3 so that 3 decimal places are displayed and it is grouped by thousands (1 pt.).
num_3 = 987654321.123456789 # DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY THIS LINE OF CODE


# 12. Write a print statement using an f-string that prints out the following sentence using the variables defined below.
# In 2017, New Zealand had a population of 4,793,700 and a life expectancy of 71.61 years. The round function
